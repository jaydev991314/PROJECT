            <p>We know that some people hold it against Martin that he kills off popular characters in his famous "A Song of Ice and Fire" series. But you shouldn't fault him for his artistic choices. The man is very generous with his fans and charities. He attends countless science fiction conventions to give talks about his characters and the series. And we really don't think he's just doing that for his health. He has auctioned off numerous "Game of Thrones" memorabilia items for charity. Also, the guy looks like Santa Claus.</p>
